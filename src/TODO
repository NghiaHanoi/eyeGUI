### VERSION 0.6
- Use UTF8-CPP for config and stylesheet
- Feature?: Distinguish between fade in and out for replacing stuff (at the moment fade out only)
    
### VERSION 0.7
- IDEA: disable opengl storing stuff by function (to save computation time)
- add comment at gui resize: one has to wait for update
- TextInput
  - Keyboard and "Guesser" (tries to goes what you want to write)
  - Both are indepenend
  - Should support unicode...
  - Different modes: Fullscreen, OnScreen, With/Without guesser
  - Differet speeds
    - Letters get bigger and after threshold: selection
    - Only last letter focused for longer time

### VERSION 0.8
- Audio (PortAudio library?)
  - Audio effects defined in style sheet

### VERSION 0.x
- Uniform locations of texture slots not used! (may be problem if there is more than one in use at once)
- Encoding stuff
	- Different XML library -> UTF8 works even in xeyegui
	- Use UTF8 library also for config and stylesheet?
- Right to left text (hebrew)
	- Maybe detect hebrew characters and react
- Localization reloading on the fly (all textflows would have to be recalculated, maybe other default font...)
- Font has sometimes little rendering issues
- Adaptive scaling is not that smooth
- Input: Consumption is strange, because for example button used input and then element update method does not know, whether it was submethod or other element. Ok, it could guess because before call of specialUpdate it was not and after that it was.

Notes:
- Reminder: Getter for transform and size do only work after first update
- Localization files MUST BE encoded in UTF-8
- Element's mBorderAspectRatio for avoiding borders to kill aspect ratio only used in picture at the moment
- maybe switch to double to accumulate time. otherwise, every half hour there will be flickering
- Precaching of textures (maybe write something to an text file)
- Maybe use sampler states for textures instead of per texture settings
- Rasterization of SVGs are depending on DPI at the moment
- Strange or hacky: Since OGL functions are loaded already by the library, what happens in the main program doing the same? Seems to work at least...
- Stack
  - Non used pixels should be better shared among all elements not only the head in stack -> very difficult stuff
- Reminder: N
- Mapping of images / icons would be cool (easy exchange in whole application) (path without .png or .svg is interperted as mapping)
- Tooltips? -> mouse hovering oder gaze when using keyboard...
- Input
  - Maybe blocks have an option: kill or not kill input (both possible)
  - is selecting via keyboard input? (at the moment it is not blocked if input is disabled for layout)

Reminders:
- Parser responsible for value ranges!
- XML may not contain information about current state (activity, hiding etc!!!)
- namespaces easier because Layout and GUI is visible to outer space
- Input: can be NULL if irrelevant for Element

If bored:
- Some members of element could be private but getters necessary..
